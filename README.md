The projects in this repository are machine and deep learning projects completed on real world data using various or different algorithms or architecture suitable to solve those problems.
Before selecting the type of algorithm, various data analysis and feature engineering processes were done on the dataset to gain insight of the trend of the data flow before making
use of a particular algorithm.
Currently the projects in the repository are machine learning projects. Deep learning projects will be uploaded in the course of time
